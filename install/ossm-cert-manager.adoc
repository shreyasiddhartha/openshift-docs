The cert-manager tool is a solution for X.509 certificate management on {k8s}. It delivers a unified API to integrate applications with private or public key infrastructure (PKI), such as Vault, Google Cloud Certificate Authority Service, Let's Encrypt, and other providers.

The cert-manager tool ensures that the certificates are valid and up-to-date by attempting to renew certificates at a configured time before they expire.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The cert-manager tool must be installed before you create and install your `{istio}` resource.
